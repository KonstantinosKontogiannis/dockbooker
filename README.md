# dockbooker

Create multi-format eBooks from the command line - using Docker.

Run a Docker image to transform your AsciiDoc documentation to:

* Multipart HTML
* PDF
* MOBI

It also makes sure that your images fit, and reprocesses them according to your destination media (for
example, images for PDF are to be 150dpi, JPEGs have a defined compression ratio, etc.)
